<p class="about">Hyderabad, city, Telangana state, south-central India. It is Telangana’s largest and most-populous city and is the major urban centre for all of south-central interior India. From 1956 to 2014 Hyderabad was the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, but, with the creation of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh in 2014,
     it was redesignated as the capital of both states.</p>
     <p class="about">Hyderabad was known for its beauty and affluence, but that glory lasted only as long as the Quṭb Shāhī dynasty. The Mughals conquered Hyderabad in 1685. The Mughal occupation was accompanied by plunder and destruction and was followed by the intervention of European powers in Indian affairs. In 1724 Āṣaf Jāh Nizam al-Mulk, the Mughal viceroy in the Deccan, declared independence. That Deccan kingdom, with Hyderabad as its capital, came to be known as the princely state of Hyderabad. The Āṣaf Jāhīs, during the 19th century, started to rebuild, expanding to the north of the old city across the Musi. Farther north, Secunderabad grew as a British cantonment (military facility), connected to Hyderabad by a bund (embankment) 1 mile (1.6 km) long on Husain Sagar Lake. The bund now serves as a promenade and is the pride of the city. Many new structures, reflecting a beautiful 
        blend of Hindu and Muslim styles, have been added along it.</p>
